The James Cook University-Rowan University IEEE partnership has existed almost as long as our club.
The already established Rowan University IEEE Student Branch helped the club grow into the full club it is today.
The international club partnership has allowed multicultural and multidisciplinary projects to take place between the clubs, living up to the IEEE motto of "Networking the World".

Next week, 10 members of Rowan University's IEEE Student Branch will visit Townsville.
During their stay, students will experience the concepts associated with engineering in the tropics.
The student's stay will include industry tours of Ergon, and JCU's facilities including the chilled water supply and storage facility.
Rowan University Students will also visit the Australian Institute of Marin Science, receiving technical presentations on their Sea Sim, and distributed sensor networks.
Of course, where would a trip to North Queensland be without trips to the Great Barrier Reef, Magnetic Island and Billabong Sanctuary.

Whilst here, the international students will also be competing in two of the club's major events: NQRoS and the Rowes Bay Sensory Sprint Day.
This collaboration will be sure to make these events all the more interesting, so be sure to head along.
