JCU Robo Club in run by JCU's IEEE Student Branch. The club began in July 2013 and has been evolving and picking up steam since.

The club’s main goals are to introduce, promote and teach robotics from an introductory level allowing members the opportunity to gain experience in a more hands on environment. The club’s main events in the past have involved robotics competitions each semester and we look to continuing these in the future. As part of these competitions, we run sessions teaching students to build robots, program microcontrollers, and interact with sensors and actuators.

If you're at JCU or in Townsville and would like to be involved, join the [JCU Robo Club Members page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/JCUrobotics/ "Member's FB Page") on Facebook.
