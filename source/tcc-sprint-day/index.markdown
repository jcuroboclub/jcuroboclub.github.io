*Having evolved over billions of years, nature has proven itself as the most effective manager of its natural resources.
As humans continue to modify their environments, there is much we can learn from how nature and animals live.
The only way we can learn from nature is to understand it, and the first step is to study it.*

## What are we doing?
The Robo Club has teamed up with [JCU eResearch](https://eresearch.jcu.edu.au) and [Townsville City Council](http://www.townsville.qld.gov.au/) to form this challenge.
Four teams will each be assigned a separate environment, and will each an Internet of Things (IoT) solution to monitor that environment.
We don't know yet what solutions the teams will come up with, but we are expecting temperature, humidity, wind speed, lighting, and other novel solutions.

## What is a Sprint?
In a sprint, a team races to complete an entire project in a single day. At the end of the day, there must be a (rough) working design, but the design must work from start to end.
This means that teams must develop a solution that gathers data, pushes it to the web, processes it, and aesthetically displays the results to a web page.

## What is the Internet of Things?

The Internet of Things (IoT) represents the growing connectivity of smart things, whether these be households, appliances, or even ecosystems. This technology offers new opportunities to study how things interact and learn from them.
